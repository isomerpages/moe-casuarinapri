**Graciousness Programme** is a key vehicle used to spread kindness in Casuarina. Through the “Friends of Singa” (FOS) project our students come together to learn, experience and display kindness through various activities. ‘Pay it forward’ also encourages Casuarinians to display kindness by expressing words of comfort, presenting hand-made flowers or even small tokens to encourage, show concern or even give support to fellow Casuarinians.

**Student Leadership Programme** provides Casuarinians ample opportunities to develop their leadership skills in a tiered progression. There are leadership opportunities at the classroom level and as students progress, they may be introduced to positions such as junior leaders and CCA leaders. In addition, students who show outstanding leadership qualities through their years in the school may get an opportunity to be part of the Executive Committee (EXCO) consisting of the Head Prefect, Vice Head Prefect who will lead a team to help students to better improve the overall school experiences.

**The Casuarinian GEM and Model Class Awards** are platforms that give recognition to deserving Casuarinians who display exemplary behaviour and desirable learning attitude consistently. The Casuarinian GEM Award, previously known as the Model Student Award, encourages students to strive to be their best during their years in the school.  

  

**i-Care@CAPS programme** aims to teach Primary 1 and 2 students to become independent and self-reliant. Integrated into the curriculum, it equips students with skills which are relevant for life such as taking care of their own needs, helping out at home, assisting in others’ needs, making good decisions and social dwellings.

**iSEARCH Programme** focuses on inculcating our school values in our students to cultivate a kinder and more caring school environment. The school also participates actively in Singapore Kindness Movement’s project, Friends of SINGA (FOS), and is in our 9th year of participation!  

  

Through this project, the students have learned that kindness comes from within them and that they hold the power to make someone’s day through a simple act of kindness. Activities like the _‘Kindness Mission’_ was planned to encourage students to take initiative to carry out kindness acts on their own accord. Students received Challenge cards filled with kindness mission to fulfill.

  

_A Kindness interactive corner_ was set up where students were occupied with meaningful activities like Kindness related puzzles and iPad games. In November 2017, we were proud to be awarded ‘The Most All-rounded Project’ for our FOS project by Singapore Kindness Movement.
