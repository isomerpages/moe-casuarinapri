**Form Teacher’s Guidance Period (FTGP)** is an important part of our children’s school life as it helps them to create a sense of belonging to the school and class. It also helps to maintain healthy Teacher-Student Relationship so that students are comfortable to approach their teachers should they need help.  

  

As a part of FTGP, **1St Day of School programme** welcomes our Primary 1 students through various activities to which help to integrate them better into the school. Our Primary 2 to 6 students also had an interactive time with their classmates and teachers. Everyone had the chance to share and discuss their holidays and to plan for the new school year.
