In Casuarina Primary School, we place importance and emphasis on the collaborative, purposeful and sustainable partnership with our partners, i.e., Parents and the Community to ensure that our students receive the best experiences and support to grow and develop to their best potential.

Our Parent Support Group (PSG) plays a pivotal role in facilitating and assisting teachers at various school events. Their involvement strengthens home-school collaboration and to build a conducive and enriching learning environment for our students. While the school provides the foundation through education, parents are significant figures in our students’ lives in values and socio-emotional learning.


**PSG@CAPS Organisational Structure**  

 We have put in place an Organisational structure which includes an Executive Committee (EXCO) and a Mentor.

Community involvement is an important form of support to provide authentic learning beyond the school. The community partners emphasise a broader development of personal and social skills. The school collaborates with Family Matters@School to conduct workshops for parents and organise the Dad’s for Life programme to promote parental involvement in school. We open our doors to external organisations such the Kindergartens in Pasir Ris and the Lions Befrienders for the Elderly. These organisations provide the resources, expertise and opportunities for students to contribute to the community.
