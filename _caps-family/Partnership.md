In Casuarina Primary School, we place importance and emphasis on the collaborative, purposeful and sustainable partnership with our partners, i.e., Parents and the Community to ensure that our students receive the best experiences and support to grow and develop to their best potential.

Our Parent Support Group (PSG) plays a pivotal role in facilitating and assisting teachers at various school events. Their involvement strengthens home-school collaboration and to build a conducive and enriching learning environment for our students. While the school provides the foundation through education, parents are significant figures in our students’ lives in values and socio-emotional learning.
