In Casuarina Primary, we are committed to our mission of “Inspire Learning and nurture character within a caring community.” We believe in building a caring community that values everyone and enables everyone to fulfil his or her potential. Teaching and learning are most effective in a caring school environment whereby children grow as confident individuals who show respect to one another. On a daily basis, we want our students to be happy in school, to enjoy learning, to grow in confidence and to develop strong character.

We thank everyone for the great support and wonderful collaboration that enable our school to thrive and emerge stronger under the exceptional circumstances caused by COVID-19 pandemic the last few years. Through it all, we realised that our children will be facing a more uncertain and fast-changing future and the need for us to prepare them well for the future.

Our vision inspires us to nurture “Lifelong learners rooted in values to lead care and serve.” In nurturing our students to be a life-long learners, we are preparing them to succeed in life and to be able to make a difference to the community and to our country. We work on igniting the joy of learning and providing enriching experiences and support for learning. As values shape character, and character determines the future, we adopt whole-school approach and develop programmes in making Character Citizen Education and Values-In-Education engaging learning experiences for our students.

At Casuarina, we live by our school motto, “Be the best we can be”. As caring educators anchored on our school motto, we give our best for our students. Every parent hopes for his child to grow up to be at his best. We share the same goal with parents for their child to be developed to his or her fullest potential. The school needs the support of everyone – staff, parents and partners – for each child to grow up to be his/her best. As such, our school fosters strong partnerships with parents and the community. Truly it takes a village to raise a child.

We are pleased to be setting up an MOE Kindergarten (MK) within Casuarina Primary School. Besides expanding our school, the siting of an MK in our school will enrich our school community. The renovation and retrofitting works will be completed this year and MK@Casuarina will be opened in January 2024 to admit Kindergarten 1 (K1) children. We look forward to welcoming pre-schoolers into our school community.         

Let’s continue to work together in giving off our best for our students and in bringing out the best in our students. 

I wish everyone a fulfilling year ahead. 


Yours sincerely,

Mrs Pek Kwee Lan

Principal of Casuarina Primary School
