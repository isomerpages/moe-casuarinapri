As the school year begins, I would like to thank everyone for the great support and wonderful collaboration that enable our school to thrive and emerge stronger under the exceptional circumstances caused by COVID-19 pandemic since last year. In the midst of this pandemic, we have stayed strong and united because we always have the interest of our students in all our hearts. With the support of parents, we are able to overcome challenges and take on many changes that come our way.

Our mission keeps us focused on inspiring learning and nurturing character within a caring community. We strongly believe that teaching and learning are most effective in a caring school environment whereby children grow as confident individuals who show respect to one another. In addition, our vision inspires us to nurture “Lifelong learners rooted in values to lead care and serve.” In nurturing every child to be a life-long learner, we work on igniting the joy of learning and providing enriching experiences and support for learning.

In Casuarina, we inculcate in our students our school GREAT values. On a daily basis, we want our pupils to be happy in school, to enjoy learning, to grow in confidence and to develop strong character. As caring educators anchored on our school motto, ‘Be the best we can be’, we give our best for our students. We share the same goal with parents for their child to be developed to his or her fullest potential.

Casuarina aims to be a school that fosters strong partnerships with parents and the community. The strong support and confidence from our parents has enabled our school to establish our distinct character and to be prepared to scale greater heights in the years to come.

Let’s continue to work together in giving off our best for our students and in bringing out the best in our students. 

I wish everyone a fulfilling year 2021.

  

Yours sincerely,

Mrs Pek Kwee Lan

Principal of Casuarina Primary School
