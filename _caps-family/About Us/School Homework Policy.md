### HOMEWORK GUIDELINES - FOR PARENTS’ REFERENCE

  

**Definition of homework**

Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required by the school to complete outside of curriculum time. This includes assignments and projects but not revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.

  

**Objectives of homework**

In Casuarina Primary School, we believe in the appropriate delivery of homework to our pupils to reinforce their learning. Therefore, homework aims to reinforce pupils learning and allow pupils to practise and apply concepts taught. It also helps to instill in them good study habits and to take ownership of their own learning.

  

For parents, homework can provide them with timely feedback on their child’s learning progress and by providing the necessary guidance, allow you the opportunity to participate in their child’s learning.

  

For the teachers, homework allows them to consolidate the concepts taught and also check for understanding. In doing so, it allows them to give timely feedback and plan intervention to address teaching and learning gaps.

  

**Guidelines on time spent on homework**

Normal school week:

  

| Level | Approximate Daily Homework |
| --- | --- |
| P1 & 2 | ½ - 1 hour |
| P3 & 4 | 1.0 – 1.5 hours |
| P5 & 6 | 1.5 – 2.0 hours |

_(Note: Duration listed is for an average child. It may vary from child to child. Your child may take more or less time to complete the same set of work)_

  

**School Holidays:**

School holidays are meant for students to take a break from formal learning and they should therefore not be given excessive homework. Moderate homework is given during the school holidays to allow pupils to keep in touch with their learning. This will be less than the load given during the school week.

  

**Communication on homework issued**

Homework to be given to the class is to be written by the teacher on the whiteboard for reference for all pupils and as well as other teachers teaching the class. Pupils will also write their homework assigned into their pupils’ handbooks.

  

**Roles and responsibilities of stakeholders**

Pupils should:

*   Understand the purpose of homework and what is expected of them;
*   Keep track of homework instructions and deadlines;
*   Manage time well to ensure that homework is completed and submitted on time;
*   Give his/her best effort in completing homework; and
*   Review feedback from teachers on homework submitted

  

Parents should:

*   Create a home environment conducive for studying and completion of homework;
*   Supervise and provide support for child’s learning;
*   Reinforce good study habits and attitudes;
*   Be mindful not to overload the child with out-of-school activities; and
*   Work in partnership with teachers to support child’s learning and development.
