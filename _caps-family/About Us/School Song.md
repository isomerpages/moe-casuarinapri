<h3><strong>Casuarina Primary School Song</strong></h3>
<h4>As we grow as one,<br>our journey has begun,<br>rooted in our values<br>we stand tall and strong,<br>reaching out to greater heights,<br>our hopes, our dreams are one.</h4>
<h4>Oh Casuarina, we serve with gratitude and pride,<br>to build a caring community, we’ll be the best we can be.<br>Against all odds, we soar up high,<br>the joy of learning, fills our hearts and minds.<br>When the wind blows, creativity flows.<br>We’ll show the world what we can do.<br></h4>
<h4>Oh Casuarina, we serve with gratitude and pride,<br>to build a caring community, we’ll be the best we can be.<br></h4>
