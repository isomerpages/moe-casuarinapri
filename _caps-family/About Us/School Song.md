<h3><strong>Casuarina Primary School Song</strong></h3>
<p>As we grow as one,
<br>our journey has begun,
<br>rooted in our values
<br>we stand tall and strong,
<br>reaching out to greater heights,
<br>our hopes, our dreams are one.</p>
<p>Oh Casuarina, we serve with gratitude and pride,
<br>to build a caring community, we’ll be the best we can be.
<br>Against all odds, we soar up high,
<br>the joy of learning, fills our hearts and minds.
<br>When the wind blows, creativity flows.
<br>We’ll show the world what we can do.
<br>
</p>
<p>Oh Casuarina, we serve with gratitude and pride,
<br>to build a caring community, we’ll be the best we can be.
