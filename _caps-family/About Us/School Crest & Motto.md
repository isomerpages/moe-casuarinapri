Our school crest paints a picture of an eagle soaring amongst trees. These elements represent the attributes that will prepare our students for the future:

  

*   The blue eagle symbolises the sense of confidence and strength that our students possess.
*   Green trees embedded with the turning pages of a book represent the deep-rooted good character of our students as they grow, and acquire knowledge and skills.
