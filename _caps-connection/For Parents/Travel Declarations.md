**All Primary 1 to 6 students** are to declare their travel plans regardless of travel intent via Parents Gateway (PG).

  

*   Before making a declaration, ensure that your contact details on the Parents Gateway are updated. Click [HERE](https://casuarinapri.moe.edu.sg/caps-connections/for-parents/travel-declarations/update-contact-details) to find out how to update your contact details.
*   If you have more than 1 child, and the declarations details are the same, please select all of them and make only 1 declaration, even if they are in different schools.
*   We will also appreciate for those who are not travelling to make a “Not Travelling” declaration.
*   Only 1 parent is required to declare.
*   Go to \[SERVICES > DECLARE TRAVELS\] to make your declaration.
