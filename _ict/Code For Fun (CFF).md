The school embarked on an MOE initiated programme, Code for Fun, for our primary 5 students in 2020. The Code for Fun programme plays an important role in MOEâ€™s computer Science Education roadmap. The aim of this programme is to:

1.  Develop an appreciation of core computational thinking and coding concepts through simple visual programming-based lessons
2.  Exposure to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Computational thinking is a learned approach and one of the better ways to learn it, is through programming.

  

This learning approach employs all the components of computational thinking and the knowledge gained through the experience of tackling programming challenges. It can provide a framework not only for computer science, but for any field from natural and health sciences, to the social sciences and humanities.
