The school embarked on an MOE initiated programme, Code for Fun, for our primary 5 students in 2020. The Code for Fun programme plays an important role in MOE’s computer Science Education roadmap. The aim of this programme is to:

1.  Develop an appreciation of core computational thinking and coding concepts through simple visual programming-based lessons
2.  Exposure to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Computational thinking is a learned approach and one of the better ways to learn it, is through programming.

  

This learning approach employs all the components of computational thinking and the knowledge gained through the experience of tackling programming challenges. It can provide a framework not only for computer science, but for any field from natural and health sciences, to the social sciences and humanities.

Programming is all about giving clear and specific instructions to a robot or computer! During these CFF workshops, students will using block-based programming to programme the Sphero Bolt (refer to picture on the left). They will be completing exciting challenges using the Sphero:  

  

**Traffic Light Function** \- Creating a function to make the Sphero act like a traffic light.

  

**Maze Runner** \- Creating their own drawings and challenging their friends to draw them

  

**Sphero Dance-off** \- Working together to create their very own Sphero Dance.
