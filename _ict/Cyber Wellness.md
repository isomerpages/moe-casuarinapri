#### Cyber Wellness Framework

The CAPS cyber wellness framework is crafted based on the MOE's Cyber Wellness framework. It serves to highlight the different stages that students undergo to self-manage their well-being in cyberspace. Embedded in this framework is a structure that promotes collaboration between teachers and parents to guide and empower our students with the right knowledge and digital skills towards their cyber wellness journey. Teachers and parents collaborate with one another via various communication modes such as the learning management system and Parents Gateway.

#### CAPS Cyber Wellness Activities

**Safer Internet Day**

Safer Internet Day is an annual global initiative that promotes the safe, responsible and positive use of digital technology. The global theme for 2019 was 'Together for a better internet'. CAPS commemorated Safer Internet Day (SID) on 8 February by broadcasting a video on 'Our Internet, our choice' for mass viewing during recess at the CAPS Theatre Lab. Upper Primary students were given the opportunity to take part in a Safer Internet Day Quiz via the Student Learning Space (SLS).

**Cyber Wellness Week**

During Cyber Wellness Week, several recess activities were carried out at the foyer. These activities were created and executed by our very own Cyber Wellness Ambassadors with the help of their Cyber Wellness Teacher Coordinators. To participate, students were given task cards on which they were supposed to collect a stamp for each activity that they complete throughout the week. Examples of activities carried out were:

*   Cyber Wellness Kahoot Quiz
*   Cyber Wellness Word Search
*   Cyber Wellness Wheel of Questions

**Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors**

Each year, two students from every primary 4 to Primary 6 classes will be nominated by their Form Teachers as the Cyber Wellness Ambassadors (CWSA) of their respective classes. As ambassadors, they are expected to promote and raise Cyber Wellness awareness among their peers. They actively support the school's Cyber Wellness programme by helping to conduct and create Cyber Wellness learning resources such as games, puzzles, comics and posters. As part of their training to prepare them for their role, our ambassadors attends workshops conducted by the school's CW Teacher Coordinators.

**Cyber Wellness Updates**

In this digital age, it is common to see technological devices in the hands of our children. They use technology in a variety of ways: they're playing games online, sending texts via their mobile phones and are constantly connected to the Internet. With the many risks and challenges involved in the cyber world, safeguarding your child online is just as important as it is in the real world. As parents, you need to support your children in harnessing it meaningfully. You can play an important role to help your child have safe and positive experiences online.

  

At times, you may not be by their side when they surf the Internet or play computer games. Hence, to complement your current parenting practices, you can use parental controls and Internet filters to safeguard your children from inappropriate websites and help them navigate the digital world safely.
