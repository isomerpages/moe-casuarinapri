The CAPS cyber wellness framework is crafted based on the MOE's Cyber Wellness framework. It serves to highlight the different stages that students undergo to self-manage their well-being in cyberspace. Embedded in this framework is a structure that promotes collaboration between teachers and parents to guide and empower our students with the right knowledge and digital skills towards their cyber wellness journey. Teachers and parents collaborate with one another via various communication modes such as the learning management system and Parents Gateway.
