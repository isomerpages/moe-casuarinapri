#### Cyber Wellness Framework

The CAPS cyber wellness framework is crafted based on the MOE's Cyber Wellness framework. It serves to highlight the different stages that students undergo to self-manage their well-being in cyberspace. Embedded in this framework is a structure that promotes collaboration between teachers and parents to guide and empower our students with the right knowledge and digital skills towards their cyber wellness journey. Teachers and parents collaborate with one another via various communication modes such as the learning management system and Parents Gateway.

#### CAPS Cyber Wellness Activities

**Safer Internet Day**

Safer Internet Day is an annual global initiative that promotes the safe, responsible and positive use of digital technology. The global theme for 2019 was 'Together for a better internet'. CAPS commemorated Safer Internet Day (SID) on 8 February by broadcasting a video on 'Our Internet, our choice' for mass viewing during recess at the CAPS Theatre Lab. Upper Primary students were given the opportunity to take part in a Safer Internet Day Quiz via the Student Learning Space (SLS).

**Cyber Wellness Week**

During Cyber Wellness Week, several recess activities were carried out at the foyer. These activities were created and executed by our very own Cyber Wellness Ambassadors with the help of their Cyber Wellness Teacher Coordinators. To participate, students were given task cards on which they were supposed to collect a stamp for each activity that they complete throughout the week. Examples of activities carried out were:

*   Cyber Wellness Kahoot Quiz
*   Cyber Wellness Word Search
*   Cyber Wellness Wheel of Questions
