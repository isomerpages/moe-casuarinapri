Reading is important as it helps in the mental, emotional and psychological growth. Every book children read gives them an opportunity to learn new things and explore new ideas. Reading books not only increases their knowledge but also expand their imagination and creativity.

  

At Casuarina Primary School, our school library is not only a source of books for students to borrow and read, it is also a source of enriching literary activities and experiences. The following are some of the examples of activities and experiences that are conducted yearly in our MRL.

1.  Library Orientation
2.  Screening of movies that originates from various literary works.
3.  Level Drama Performances.
4.  Storytelling by parent volunteers.
5.  Thematic Activities (e.g. Mother's Day, Cyber Wellness, International Friendship Day, etc)

  

In order to ensure that our Media Resource Library is up-to-date and that our students have access to rich reading resources, we work closely with the National Library. The following resources have been provided by NLB to promote the love for reading:
