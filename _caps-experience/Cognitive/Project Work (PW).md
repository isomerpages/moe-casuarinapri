CAPS PW framework is developed based on the infusion of project-based learning (PBL) and experiential learning approach. The PBL approach advocates learning with opportunities to respond to real-world challenges through extended inquiry. Through PBL, learning experiences become engaging and occurs within a created context that focuses on achievement, self-mastery and contribution to the community. Adding on the component of action and reflection is the experiential approach. Its cycle of four elements namely, concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation and active implementation, provides a good structure in designing a PW task.

  

CAPS project work content is an integration of various subjects. Through project work, students get the opportunity to apply what they have learned in subject areas such as English Language, Mathematics, Science, Art, Social studies, etc, in authentic experiences. In 2017, CAPS project work integrated the substantial use and application of ICT in the creation of PW final product. This move opens up opportunities for students to acquire ICT and media literacy skills which are vital in today's robust environment.
