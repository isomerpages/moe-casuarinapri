Central to the curriculum framework for Primary Science is the inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry as well as a sense of appreciation and care for nature. Our Science teachers equip our students with the relevant skills and attitudes as well as provide them with experiences which ignite their curiosity, creativity and critical thinking. We believe that every child is curious about the world they live in and that Science is a part of our daily life. In CAPS, we also bring the learning of Science out of the classrooms so students can see how Science is relevant to the real world around them.

#### Key Programmes

**Every Child a Seed**

In collaboration with NParks, this programme seeks to provide the P3 students with an opportunity to grow their very own plant. This gives them a chance to go through and appreciate the challenges of the planting process, and experience the joy of seeing their plants grow. At the same time, the students will learn about the life cycle of a plant, plant parts and their functions. The values of care and responsibility will also be reinforced.

**Hydroponics**

This programme provides opportunities for the P4 students to learn Science beyond the confines of the classroom, in a fun and enjoyable way. The programme is specially designed to connect classroom teaching, and aims to complement and support the school’s Science curriculum. P4 students will experience the excitement of ‘hands-on’ discovery while learning valuable content.

**Spark Gallery**

Spark Gallery provides opportunities for students to learn more about sustainability. Sustainability activities that integrate school sustainability features (e.g. hydroponics and solar panels) are conducted by teachers to make learning more authentic. Unstructured play are planned for students to explore the area and learn through play e.g. food web floor game and interactive stations like maglev train and hydraulic crane. They are also able to use ipads/tablets to participate in deck.toys challenge and scan the QR code to read more information related to sustainability.

**Recycling Programme**

It aims to educate our students on the importance of 3R. Our CCE ambassadors take on the task of encouraging the act of recycling in class. On Wednesdays, they bring their class’s recyclable wastes to the weighing stations manned by parent volunteers to track their collection. In Art lessons, students are encouraged to make use of recycled materials in Art lessons where they are given a new lease of life and transformed into beautiful art pieces.

**Learning Journeys**

In making Science concepts authentic and relevant, the students go on learning journeys to various places in Singapore to provide them the opportunity to see, feel, touch and hear the natural environment and understand the concepts behind what they observe in their surroundings.

Students also visit the Singapore Science Centre and are engaged in the lessons. It is through these experiences that our students will be able to better understand Science concepts which are taught in school.

**CAPS Garden**

Our garden provides green pockets of garden landscape in the school which serves both aesthetic and educational purposes. There are plots of flowering plants, fruit trees, herbs, cacti and climbers, and vegetables. Students frequently spot some ‘visitors’ like butterflies, dragonflies and birds in our garden. The garden also features two large eco-pond, complete with clear glass panels, for the students to have an outdoor experiential learning opportunity to explore and learn more about the different plants and animals around them.

CAPS garden has attained the ‘Gold’ certification and ‘Outstanding Educational Community Garden’ achievement ribbon at the Community in Bloom organised by NParks.  It also clinched the Yellow Flame award in the School Green Awards for our green efforts.
