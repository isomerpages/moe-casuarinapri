In Casuarina Primary School, we believe that students learn best when they enjoy the process of learning. To inculcate the joy of learning in Mathematics, meaningful learning experiences are planned to engage and empower our students to explore mathematical ideas and problems within and beyond the classroom.

The **Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract** approach is a key instructional strategy used in our school to develop conceptual understanding and skills in Mathematics. Students use concrete objects, experiences and pictorial representations to construct meaning and make connections with abstract mathematical ideas and concepts.

Through **collaborative learning** experiences, students have opportunities to communicate their reasoning, make connections across topics as well as build confidence and foster interest in Mathematics.

**Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)**  

Our LSM programme aims to provide early intervention in small class settings for Primary 1 and 2 students who need more guidance. Identified students are supported by a LSM teacher through activity-based lessons which celebrate small successes to build confidence.  

  

**Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**  

For the middle primary levels, the ICAN programme supports our low-readiness students using intervention strategies to address the four key issues of learning: learning gaps, language, motivation and memory. Believing that every child can learn, teachers acknowledge and attribute success to students’ effort. In this way, teachers create a safe, non-threatening classroom environment and make learning meaningful.  

  

**Excellence 2000 (E2K)**

The E2K is an enrichment programme for Primary 4 to 5 students who demonstrate an aptitude for Mathematics. Through an inquiry-based approach, students collaborate with their peers and engage in critical thinking through puzzles, games and mathematical explorations. Teachers aim to deepen students’ conceptual understanding as well as develop important 21st-century competencies including inventive thinking, reasoning and effective communication skills.  

  

**Mathematics Olympiad Competitions**  

Students in the E2K programme who display exceptional aptitude for Mathematics will have the opportunity to participate in Mathematics Olympiad competitions such as:  

\-    Mathlympics

\-    Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad (SASMO)

\-    Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS) – organised by Hwa Chong Institution

\-    National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) – organised by NUS High School

  

These inter-school competitions provide students invaluable exposure and experience to realise their fullest potential.
