The school organises 2D1N Outdoor Adventure Camp for all Primary 4 students and a 3D2N Outdoor Adventure Camp for all Primary 5 students yearly. The camps aims to cultivate in our students, a lifelong interest in physical outdoor activities as well as to raise an awareness of the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle. Students work cooperatively with their peers, develop leadership skills, manage their personal health and well-being and experience a variety of outdoor activities. These will contribute to the students’ development of lifelong interests in outdoor activities.
