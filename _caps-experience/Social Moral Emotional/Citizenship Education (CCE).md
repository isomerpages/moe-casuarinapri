In Casuarina Primary School, we believe that good character can be built and social-emotional competencies can be nurtured in every student. As we prepare our students for the skills and knowledge for what lies ahead in the future, it is far more important to have our students be grounded by their moral compass, equipped with social emotional competencies and be guided by their sense of purpose so that they may be empowered to act in face of opportunities and challenges of the 21st century.

  

In crafting meaningful CCE learning experiences for our students, we are in cognisant of the 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes Framework.

Our key CCE programmes emphasises the interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for character and citizenship development of our students.
