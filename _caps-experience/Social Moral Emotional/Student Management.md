Mission :Â **To nurture Self-Discipline**

  

  

The school has a Referral System (also known as the Stage Model) that indicates clearly the different referral processes at different stages for teachers to refer students who need help in learning, emotionally and behavioural issues.

  

The school uses a whole school approach where discipline is concerned. Every teacher takes charge of the discipline of his/her students. The teachers also use the CSI (Clarify-Sensitise-Influence) questioning technique to steer students in the right direction.

  

We work very closely with the CCE department to strengthen the learning of values in Casuarinians.
