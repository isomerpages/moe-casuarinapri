English Language
================

In Casuarina Primary School, we believe in nurturing children to be engaged **21st Century EL learners - _Empathetic Communicators, Creative Inquirers and Discerning Readers_**.

  

Structured and explicit instruction based on the STELLAR (**STELLAR** \- **ST**rategies for **E**nglish **L**anguage **L**earning **A**nd **R**eading) and school-based curriculum help to build a strong foundation in language skills, grammar and vocabulary. Hands-on learning experiences, collaborative discussions on iPads, gallery walks and learning journeys, are among the many learning experiences in and beyond the classrooms, tailored to make the learning of the English Language engaging and enjoyable for our students. These learning experiences as well as the various English Language programmes and activities such as the CAPS ‘I Love Reading!’ Programme and the English Language Signature Programme – _The Art of Language_ \- develop our students into self-assured Casuarinians who are proficient users of the English Language and able to articulate their thoughts with confidence.
