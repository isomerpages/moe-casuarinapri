Nature-based Education (NBE) is Casuarina Primary School’s Applied Learning Programme. It leverages on Inquiry Pedagogy to provide students with learning opportunities to construct their own meaning of knowledge and skills acquired, thus helping them to make sense of concepts learnt by applying and connecting them to the real world.

The aims of the programme are to nurture students with inquiring minds and responsible students who care for the environment they live in. Students explore freely in the garden and make discoveries for themselves. Elements of the natural world are used as focal points for teaching and learning during lessons, providing opportunity for students to connect knowledge and skills across subject disciplines. All students also learn the importance of protecting and preserving their environment and apply their learning through programmes like CAPS Go Green Programme.

In line with broader educational goals, the school hopes to nurture students under cognitive, affective and moral domains. Under cognitive development, NBE provides a meaningful environment where students get to learn in context, bringing about deeper understanding, greater retention and better appreciation of concepts taught. Interacting with the natural world will also engage students’ affective capacities such as wonder, imagination and joy. When students experience emotional states of wonderment and curiosity, they form emotional interests that inspire them to seek and understand information and ideas. The element of value inculcation is pivotal in the school’s NBE as they learn about values such as care and responsibilities. More importantly, they are given opportunity to explore, discover and develop their personalities and identities.

The NBE Curriculum not only involves the whole school and cut across the various departments, it also serves to impact students across the levels. The NBE curriculum comprises Nature-Infused School Programmes and Nature-Infused lessons, which are further classified under Nature Exploration; Nature Conservation; and Nature as Learning Context.

  

Besides using the school gardens as a platform for teaching and learning, students also went on learning journey to nature sites where elements of natural world are used as focal points for teaching and learning, providing opportunity for students to connect knowledge and skills across subject disciplines. They also embarked on projects and learn beyond the classroom. P3 and P5 students were engaged in Interdisciplinary Project Work after their learning journey to Dairy Farm Nature Farm and Sungei Buloh respectively.

The theme of nature is also infused into one of the domains of Programme for Active Learning (PAL), Outdoor Education. Students get to explore and interact freely and spontaneously with the natural environment. Through their personal interaction with the natural environment, students learn more about their role in the environment and more specifically, how their actions impact the environment around them.
