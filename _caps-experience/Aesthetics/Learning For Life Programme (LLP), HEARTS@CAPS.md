**HE’ARTS@CAPS**

  

The HE’ARTS@CAPS aims to provide students with a holistic education. The AE education programme serves to develop students in creativity and expression and through targeted learning experiences, promote inter-ethnic bonding and cultural heritage, thus cultivating a sense of national pride and identity. It serves to integrate AE with other areas of focus of the school namely ICT, e.g., through Digital Art and Music, Effective Communication, e.g., through Speech and Drama, National Education ,e.g., Heritage Art, Dance and Music and instilling of school values.

  

The HE’ARTS@CAPS aims to involve all students through the various programmes and initiatives planned for each level. This is done in a progressive manner based on the constructivist approach to develop students’ talents, skills and aptitude as well as maximise students’ potential to the fullest.

  

HE’ARTS@CAPS complements the school’s Talent Development Programme (TDP) to provide additional opportunities for students with the identified aptitude in the arts to stretch and demonstrate their talents. The various programmes under HE’ARTS@CAPS offers an authentic platform for the development of 21st century competencies and character.
