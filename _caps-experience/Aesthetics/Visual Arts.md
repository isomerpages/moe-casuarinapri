Art Programme
-------------

The art curriculum at Casuarina Primary School aims to nurture our students’ interest and aptitude as well as in visual art and develop their skills in art making. In Casuarina, our art curriculum encompasses a range which include digital art through photography, Manga Drawing and Claymation.  

  

The exposure to and learning of the art, through structured and integrated visual art experiences, provide a natural platform for the inculcation of our school values and the 21st Century Competencies skills in our students.

  

Students are also given various platforms and opportunities to showcase their learning outside the classroom through art exhibitions and participation in art competitions and events.
