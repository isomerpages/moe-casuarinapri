<p>Are you looking for a quality and affordable kindergarten programme for
your preschool child?</p>
<p>At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are joyful, curious, active
and competent learners and we are committed to giving every child a strong
start. Our holistic curriculum and programmes nurture children’s confidence,
social skills, bilingualism and build a good foundation in literacy and
numeracy.</p>
<p>Our curriculum is developed by MOE’s curriculum specialists and trained
educators with knowledge and experience in early childhood education and
who are familiar with the primary school curriculum. Your child will embark
on an exciting learning journey through our two flagship programmes – the
HI-Light Programme and the Starlight Literacy Programme for English and
Mother Tongue Language. These programmes focus on the holistic development
of children and seek to ignite the joy of learning in them.</p>
<p>MOE Kindergarten @ Casuarina will begin its operations in January 2024.&nbsp;
Should you require a full-day service for your child, we also offer Kindergarten
Care (KCare) at our MK. If you register, your child will be in KCare before
and after the MK session, providing a full-day programme for your child
within the same premises.</p>
