#### Kindergarten Care at MOE Kindergarten

Kindergarten Care (KCare) is available in all MOE Kindergartens (MK) located within primary schools. If you register, your child can be in KCare after their MK session, providing the convenience of a full-day service.  
  
KCare operates from Monday to Friday, 12pm to 7pm (school term) and 7am to 7pm (school holidays).  
It is closed on public holidays and up to 6 additional days each year.  

The programme includes meals as well as activities designed to provide time and space for children to play, explore and discover through:  

* Indoor and outdoor modular activities, such as tinkering, cookery and gardening activities.

* Indoor and outdoor play, such as dramatic play, and sand and water play.

We work with Raffles Student Care to help us run our KCare services.  
  
Raffles Student Care Centre was established in 2008 and has been operating community and school-based student care and KCare centres at various locations across the country. Guided by their vision of&nbsp;Building Our Next Generation, Raffles serves to inculcate core values and life skills to the young children to ensure they grow up well.

KCare is a service offered to parents whose children attend MOE Kindergarten and need care services beyond the 4-hour programme of MK.&nbsp; KCare operates from 12pm to 7pm on Mondays to Fridays (school term) and 7am to 7pm (school holidays).  
  
They operate half-days on Christmas Eve, New Year’s Eve and Chinese New Year’s Eve. The centre will be closed up to 6 days each year, in addition to public holidays (closure dates will be shared with parents at the start of the school term).  

The KCare programme has been designed to complement the MOE Kindergarten’s curriculum.  
It emphasizes the provision of time and space for children to play, explore and discover. The programme also focuses on the importance of providing opportunities for the children to develop confidence, self-help skills, social skills and values such as responsibility, care and respect in a safe and conducive environment.
