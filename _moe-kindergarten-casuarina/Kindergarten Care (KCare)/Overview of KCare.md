#### Kindergarten Care at MOE Kindergarten

Kindergarten Care (KCare) is available in all MOE Kindergartens (MK) located within primary schools. If you register, your child can be in KCare after their MK session, providing the convenience of a full-day service.  
  
KCare operates from Monday to Friday, 12pm to 7pm (school term) and 7am to 7pm (school holidays).  
It is closed on public holidays and up to 6 additional days each year.  

The programme includes meals as well as activities designed to provide time and space for children to play, explore and discover through:  

* Indoor and outdoor modular activities, such as tinkering, cookery and gardening activities.

* Indoor and outdoor play, such as dramatic play, and sand and water play.
