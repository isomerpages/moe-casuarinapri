The Choir provides the platform for students who love singing to develop their vocal talents and performance skills to their fullest potential. Choir members have the opportunities to develop their self-confidence by showcasing their singing talents in school and community events where they captivate the audience with their melodious voices.

  

Our Choir members performed at various platforms - school-based performances such as National Day Celebration and Annual Award Ceremony.
