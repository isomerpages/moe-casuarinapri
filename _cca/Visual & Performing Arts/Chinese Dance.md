<p>Traditional Chinese dancers have the ability to express a variety of feelings
through their poised movements. Chinese Dance CCA provides a platform for
students to learn dance movements and techniques. Through various performances
and competitions, dancers will gain self-confidence and have a deeper&nbsp;
appreciation in the arts. Most importantly, dancers learn and understand
the value of resilience, responsibility and teamwork.</p>
<p>Our Chinese Dance members performed at various platforms namely&nbsp;
school-based and public performances such as Teacher’s Day and Annual Award
Ceremony.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Chinese Dance CCA participated in the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, the Chinese Dance CCA will be taking part in the SYF 2024.</p>
