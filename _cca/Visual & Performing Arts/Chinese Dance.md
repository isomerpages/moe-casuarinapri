Traditional Chinese dancers have the ability to express a variety of feelings through their poised movements. Chinese Dance in CAPS aims to provide a platform for students to learn dance movements and techniques. Through various performances and competitions, dancers gained self-confidence and appreciation for aesthetics. Most importantly, dancers learn and understand the value of teamwork.

  

Our Chinese Dance members performed at various school-based celebrations and our very own school musical production.
