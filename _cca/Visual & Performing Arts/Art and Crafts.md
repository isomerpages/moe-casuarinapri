The Art & Crafts CCA provides the platform for students to create and appreciate the arts. Students will be exposed to different art skills as they create their own art pieces.

  

Besides creating art pieces and learning within the school context, students will have the opportunity to learn beyond school. One such example is the learning journey to Changi Airport and Garden By the Bay. These learning platforms enable our Art & Crafts CCA members to understand and appreciate art pieces.

  

In 2019, as part of our partnership with the community, our Art & Crafts CCA members conducted art workshops to engage the community in art-making. Participants enjoyed learning a new craft as they create their own mosaic trays.
