The Concert Band provides the platform for students to learn a variety of wind, brass and percussion instruments. Our students performed at various school-based celebrations such as National Day Observance Ceremony and Annual Award Ceremony.

  

Our Concert Band was selected to perform during SYF Band Jamboree which was held at Our Tampines Hub. The Band was also privileged to be given the opportunity to collaborate with Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore School to perform during Extra Ordinary Celebration 2019 held at University Cultural Centre, NUS.
