In Modern Dance, our dancers are exposed to different genres of dance. Our dancers are also provided with the opportunities to shine and display their talents in performances and competitions. The dances are choreographed by experienced instructors and our dancers are able to tell a story and express themselves through their graceful movements. Through dancing, our dancers gradually evolve into a more confident individual with much perseverance.
