At Infocomm Technology CCA, students are given access to the latest technology to express their thoughts and ideas into visual forms. For example, they produce video clips that are based on school values. They are taught to storyboard, plan and shoot a video. They are also taught video editing skills and introduced to other post production tools. The students take part in the School Digital Media Awards and other competitions that require digital competency (for example, game creation). Theyâ€™ve also had their hand in stop motion animation and photography competitions.

  

**Teachers-in-charge:**
* Mr Jackson Yeo
* Mr Daniel Lee
* Miss Nashima Banu
