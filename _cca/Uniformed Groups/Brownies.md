Casuarina Primary School Brownies was formed in 2004. The school pack is known as CAPS Pack 1. During our Brownies meetings, the Brownies and Tweenies play games, sing songs, do craftworks and learn skills such as cooking, sewing and tent-pitching. We help out during school events such as Upper Primary and Lower Primary Games Day. Our brownies actively participate in the events organised by the Girl Guideâ€™s Association such as the World Thinking Day Celebration, East Division Day and the National Brownie Challenge. We build friendships with Brownies and Girl Guides from other schools as we attend camps together.

  **Teachers-in-charge of Brownies:** 

* Mdm Marina Nasib
* Mdm Halena Abd Rahman
* Miss Khaireen Faezah
