Values in Scouting:

*   Teamwork
*   Independence
*   Leadership
*   Holistic development

  

A scout is to be trusted, loyal, disciplined and considerate. He needs to have courage in facing all difficulties. He makes friends, establishes and maintains harmonious relations. Cub scouts from Casuarina Primary School will learn simple scouting skills, participate in meaningful activities organized by the Singapore Scout Association, to build good character and develop holistically.
