**Girls**

  

Floorball is a fast and intense game because of the speed and variability during the matches. Through hard work, discipline, teamwork and skill we strive to instil in the players the determination to be the best that they can be. We also seek to develop the students holistically through trainings, competitions and platforms. We also provide meaningful opportunities for students to develop their leadership.

  

The Senior and Junior Floorball girls’ team participated in the Senior and Junior National School Games Floorball Girls Division respectively.

  

In 2019, the Senior Girls team took part in the Singapore Floorball Association (SFA) Senior Division tournament and garnered the 1st Team Placing in their division. The Junior team demonstrated great determination, hard work, and the value of sportsmanship, to come forth in the 2nd Team placing in their Tier 1 division.
