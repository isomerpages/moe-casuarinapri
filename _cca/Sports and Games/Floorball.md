**Boys**

  

Floorball CCA in Casuarina Primary School focuses on developing the students in the knowledge and skills in Floorball. Besides knowledge and skills, values and character development is emphasised to ensure a well-rounded and holistic CCA.

  

Our Senior and Junior Floorball Boysâ€™ teams participated in the Senior and Junior National School Games Floorball Boys Division respectively.

  

In 2019, our Senior Team clinched the 5th to 8th placing in their Division and the Junior Team emerged 4th placing in their Tier 1 Division. Both teams demonstrated resilience, comradery and commitment throughout the training and competition seasons. The boys displayed the value of sportsmanship and teamwork, crucial in contributing to their achievements and support provided by the coach and teachers.
