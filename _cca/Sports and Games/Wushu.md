Wushu CCA strives to equip all our students with mental resilience, tenacity, perseverance and improvement in overall physical well-being.

  

Our Wushu members participated in the National School Games Wushu Competition. Through this competition, our students learn and demonstrate the values of teamwork, resilience, and sportsmanship

  

In 2019, our Wushu CCA members put up a wonderful performance for our school musical.
