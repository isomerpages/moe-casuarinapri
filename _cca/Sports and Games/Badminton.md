Badminton CCA focuses on providing students with the opportunity to acquire badminton skills such as footwork, drive and smash. In addition, values such as respect, discipline, integrity and fair play are inculcated in students through their involvement in this CCA.

  

The year 2019 was an exciting year for the students in Badminton. In providing opportunities for students to excel in sports, our P6 students did well in the National School Games Badminton Championship. Our students showed grit and resilience during the competition.
