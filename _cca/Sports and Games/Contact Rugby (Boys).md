Contact Rugby is one of the sports CCAs offered in Casuarina Primary School. In Contact Rugby, it is always about discipline, teamwork and caring for one another on and off the field. Amongst other values, we aim to develop in our boys the values of Sportsmanship, Discipline, Teamwork, Integrity, Leadership skills, Physical and Mental resilience. The CCA is open to Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who have the interest and commitment in the game. This CCA definitely offers much more things beyond the contact rugby skills acquired during the training sessions.

  

In 2019, the Senior and Junior Rugby boys participated in the National Primary Schools Rugby Ready Carnivals and the National Primary Schools Championships. The boys demonstrated determination and resilience during the games. As a team, the boys displayed a wonderful attitude on and off the field. The boys have definitely gained valuable exposure and risen to the challenges.
