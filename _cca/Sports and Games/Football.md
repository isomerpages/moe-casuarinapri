Football CCA provides the platform for students to develop their set skills in football through drills and modified games. Apart from honing their football skills, students learn the importance of teamwork and the values of perseverance, resilience as well as respect.

  

Our boys participated in the Junior and Senior Division of the National School Games. Throughout the tournament, our boys demonstrated incredible teamwork and resilience.

  

In 2019, our Primary 4 boys took part in the FAS Inter-school Futsal competition in July and emerged Champions in the Plate category.
