Drop-Off and Pick-Up by Parents who drive
-----------------------------------------

  

If you are driving your child to school, please note the drop-off procedures in the morning as follows:  

*   Between 7.00 a.m. and 7.30 a.m., parents can drive into our school premise and drop off their child at the designated alighting point in front of the school's porch. Please be considerate to other drivers by getting your child ready to alight quickly and safely, when you stop at the alighting point. Do be careful and patient, and drive out of gate B in an orderly manner.
*   At and after 7.30 a.m., the vehicle gate will be closed and parents are to drop off their children at Gate A (Security Post). The students who are late will wait at the front porch and join their classes after the flag-raising ceremony.

  

If you are driving to pick up your child from school, please note the pick-up arrangements as follows:

*   At school dismissal time, please do not drive into the school premises as the school buses are waiting for our students in the carpark. Parents are strongly encouraged to park their vehicles at nearby public carparks and take a short walk to school to pick children up. For safety reasons, you are advised not to park your vehicle along the main road to wait for your child.
*   In the event of wet weather, parents will be allowed to drive into the school compound to fetch their children only after all the school buses have left the school premises.
