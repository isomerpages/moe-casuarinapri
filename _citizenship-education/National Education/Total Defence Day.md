The school commemorated Total Defence Day from 9th to 13th February 2015. The theme for this year was ‘Our SAF: Giving Strength to Our Nation’. This year also marked the 50 years of the formation of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). As a tribute to SAF, students were enlightened about the evolvement and involvement of the SAF over the 50 years. Various activities, such as fire evacuation drill, electricity shutdown exercise and porridge rationing during recess were conducted to allow students to experience close to real life situations and to learn to cope with complexities of life. These meaningful activities provided an insight as well as promoted deep understanding on the five aspects of Total Defence and encouraged students to live their lives as persons of good character and useful citizens in the Total Defence of Singapore to strengthen Singapore’s resilience as a nation.
