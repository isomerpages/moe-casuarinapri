Primary five students attended the annual NE Show on Saturday, 11 July. The theme for this year’s NE SHOW was “Majulah Singapura”. As the NE Show coincides with Singapore’s Golden Jubilee, it was held at the Padang, the site of many historically significant moments over the past 50 years. The NE Show aimed to instil a sense of national pride and bring out the patriotic sprit of our students as we celebrate the success of our nation. Students viewed a showcase of Singapore’s defence capabilities and enjoyed the Singapore story through a colourful display of sights and sounds. They were mesmerised seeing the transformation of our small fishing village to a beautiful city much to the awe of the other nations. This Golden Jubilee celebration was indeed a significant moment for our students as it ignited the Singapore spirit in our young generation.
