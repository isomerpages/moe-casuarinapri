The theme for Racial Harmony Day this year was “Harmony in Our Hands”. The RHD celebrations were a reminder that promoting social cohesion and racial harmony requires collaborative efforts from educators, students and stakeholders such as parents. To help students internalise the racial harmony messages, the school, together with our Parent Support Group, organised various activities from 20th to 24th July. Students gained an insight of what RHD was all about during the school’s assembly programme. They put on their ethnic costumes and were actively engaged in various activities related to our multi-racial society.

  

This year, students ‘stepped into’ the kitchens of the various races, gained understanding into the various utensils commonly used by the Chinese, Indian, Malay and the Eurasians and got themselves involved in the making of various traditional dishes during their recesses. In addition, they also had the opportunity to make and sample their own rojak. Our school canteen was transformed into a Kampong Kitchen selling the dishes unique to the different races. Tea Appreciation was also another activity that allowed students to sample the tea of the various races. Visitors from Xi’an Hi-Tech International School, China, joined us in the celebration and had an enriching experience learning about our culture and understanding that we are diverse yet united for the progress of our nation. This year’s RHD celebration heightened students’ awareness and appreciation of the different races and enabled them to understand that unity is our strength.
