IFD was commemorated between 6th and 10th April 2015. The theme for International Friendship Day was ‘Deepening International Friendships’. A series of activities were lined up to engage students and also to get them to reflect on their role in welcoming and integrating with our new citizens as well as the non-Singaporeans who have chosen to make Singapore their home. New International Students received a welcome card made by our NE Ambassadors. Students also had a good opportunity to immerse and find out about the culture of various countries such as Brazil, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Mexico by participating in activities during recess. They tried out costumes, played musical instruments, engaged in making crafts depicting the different countries and even learnt the native languages. Besides that, students also gained an insight on how Singapore fostered relationships with other countries through our late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
