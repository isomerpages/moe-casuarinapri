The school celebrated our nationâ€™s 50 years of independence proudly as it was the most significant event of the year. The march in of our national flag by representatives of our uniform group members, recollection of our past, singing our National Anthem and reciting our pledge as loyal citizens were indeed very emotional moments for many of us. As we commemorated the event, students were brought through the journey we had taken as a Nation in achieving our success. To add on to the celebration mood, our school choir led the whole school in community singing and our Primary four students brought out the Singapore spirit in us by immersing us in National Day cheers and performance. Our parent volunteers too, joined us in the celebration and performed a fusion dance depicting our multi-cultural society. A cake cutting ceremony was held during the celebration as well. Teachers, representing the four races, parent support group chairperson, student representatives from Primary 1 and Primary 6 and our school leaders cut the cake as the whole school sang the birthday song for our nation as one united people. It was a very patriotic moment for all of us to come together as we celebrated Our Golden Jubilee.
