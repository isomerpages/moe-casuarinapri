The International Students and the NEVIA ambassadors went on a learning journey to various places of worship in the North-Eastern part of Singapore in March. Through these visits, they learned more about the various races and religions to increase their appreciation of Singapore as a multi-racial and multi-religious society. At the same time, they were able to familiarize themselves with the various buildings and landmarks.
