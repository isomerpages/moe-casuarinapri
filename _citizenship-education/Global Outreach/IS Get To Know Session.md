The school organised some activities this year for our new International Students (IS). These events are part of the schoolâ€™s Integration Programme to promote deeper integration among our local and international students. The first event was a Get-to-Know session between the new IS and the NEVIA ambassadors to allow new friendships to form. The IS visited the various National Education (NE) corners in the school and were engaged in a hands-on activity with the NEVIA ambassadors.
