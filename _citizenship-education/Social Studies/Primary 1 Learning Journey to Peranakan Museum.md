In line with the new Social Studies syllabus, our Primary 1 students went to the Singapore Philatelic Museum. The objectives are to understand the similarities and differences among people in terms of ethnicity and traits which allow them to know that they are unique; and to learn and share about their common attributes, such as kinship and ethnicity with the groups they belong to.

  

Through this learning journey, students learned more about the way of life of the Peranakans, mainly the food and wedding customs. They had the opportunity to find out about the different motifs and their representations on the wedding attire, apparels and accessories. They also learnt to compare a typical Peranakan kitchen and a more modern kitchen. At the end of the learning journey, students learnt to better appreciate family life.
