Our Primary 2 students went to the Singapore Philatelic Museum as part of their SS learning journey. The objectives are to recognise that common Identity, shared experiences and values unite different races in Singapore; and appreciate different customs and traditions that are practiced by the diverse communities in Singapore.

  

The students had the opportunity to go into various rooms to learn more about the origins of stamps, the representation of stamps from different countries as well as the continents of the world on the 3D World Map. Students went through a heritage trail where they learned about the customs and cultures of different races through the exhibits and artefacts that were displayed. At the end of the learning journey, students learned to appreciate the customs and traditions practised by the diverse communities in Singapore.
