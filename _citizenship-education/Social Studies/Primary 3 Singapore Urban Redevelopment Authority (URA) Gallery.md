The Primary 3 students went to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Gallery as part of their SS learning journey. The objectives are to understand the story behind the nation’s planning and physical transformation and know the different ways in which land is planned effectively for people to live, work and play.

  

Students went through the various stations in the gallery to explore the exhibits, videos and models that tell of Singapore’s planning journey. They had the opportunity to play an interactive game ‘SingCity’, in which, students became planners for the day and view the sights and sounds of Singapore through a 270-degree panoramic show. At the end of the learning journey, students learned that it was Singapore’s distinct characters that make Singapore a unique district and country.
