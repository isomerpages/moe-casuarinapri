The Primary Three students focus on the CCE Domain School. The students acquire social awareness and apply interpersonal skills to build and maintain positive relationships with their peers and school cleaners based on mutual respect. They also show care and concern for others especially the school cleaners and contribute actively to the cleanliness of the school canteen. Through the VIA experience, they learn to appreciate the efforts of the school cleaners. They reflect on the experiences that they have gained through the VIA task and learn how they can continue the cleaning effort outside school context.
