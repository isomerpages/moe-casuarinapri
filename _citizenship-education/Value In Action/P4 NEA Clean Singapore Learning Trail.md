The Primary Four students focused on the CCE Domain Community. The students learn to care for others and contribute actively to the progress of their community and nation. They learn the challenges that Singapore face in its cleanliness journey and heighten their spirit in keeping their surrounding clean. The students empathise with the cleaners in Singapore for the long working hours and their dedication in keeping Singapore clean. Students did the community clean up activity at the nearby park. They reflected on their experiences and discussed on ways to promote awareness of keeping the public parks clean to the community.
