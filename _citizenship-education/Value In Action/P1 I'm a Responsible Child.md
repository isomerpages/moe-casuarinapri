The Primary One students focus on the CCE Domain Self. They acquire self-awareness and apply self-management skills to achieve personal well-being and effectiveness in packing their school bags daily as well as managing their personal workstations in the classrooms. They also learn to be responsible for maintaining their personal cleanliness. Teachers and parents provide feedback to their child on their ability to achieve their VIA tasks.
