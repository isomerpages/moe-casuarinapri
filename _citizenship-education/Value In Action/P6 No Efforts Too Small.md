The Primary 6 students focused on the CCE Domain World. They discuss on the needs of the world and researched on how they can do their part in making the world a better place to live in. Students responded by reflecting on how the issues could be solved or prevented. Their completed end-product was presented in class to create awareness among their peers and it also helped to raise the schoolâ€™s awareness on these nation-wide and worldwide issues.
